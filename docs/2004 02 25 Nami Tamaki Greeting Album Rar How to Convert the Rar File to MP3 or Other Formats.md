After the success of Greeting, Tamaki released three more albums: Make Progress (2005), Speciality (2006), and Don't Stay (2007).

In 2009, Tamaki left her original label Sony Music and signed with Universal Music. She changed her stage name to nami and released a mini-album called STEP. However, the mini-album did not sell well and she soon returned to her original name. In 2010, she released a best-of album called NT GUNDAM COVER and a new single called "Friends!".
 
In 2011, Tamaki moved to another label, Warner Music Japan. She released two singles, "Missing You Time Machine" and "LADY MIND", which had a more mature and sophisticated sound.
