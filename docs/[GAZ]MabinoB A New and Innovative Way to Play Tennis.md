[GAZ]MabinoB is a novel monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 protein on B cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a role in autoimmune diseases. By binding to CD20, [GAZ]MabinoB depletes B cells and reduces their ability to produce harmful antibodies that attack the body's own tissues.
 
[GAZ]MabinoB is currently being developed by Gazelle Therapeutics, a biotechnology company that focuses on innovative treatments for autoimmune diseases. [GAZ]MabinoB is in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and SjÃ¶gren's syndrome.

## What are the Benefits of [GAZ]MabinoB?
 
[GAZ]MabinoB has several potential advantages over existing therapies for autoimmune diseases. First, [GAZ]MabinoB is designed to be more selective and specific than other anti-CD20 antibodies, such as rituximab and ocrelizumab. This means that [GAZ]MabinoB may have fewer side effects and lower risk of infections.
 
Second, [GAZ]MabinoB is engineered to have a longer half-life than other anti-CD20 antibodies, which means that it can stay in the body longer and maintain its therapeutic effect. This may allow for less frequent dosing and more convenient administration.
 
Third, [GAZ]MabinoB is expected to have a synergistic effect with other immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate and corticosteroids. This may enhance the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy.
