In this article, we will show you how to use Ilya Efimov LP Guitar LP Strum Kontakt.rar to create some guitar parts for a rock song. We will use Reaper as our DAW, but you can use any DAW that supports Kontakt plugins.
 
First, we need to create a new track and load the LP Guitar instrument. We can choose from three different pickups: bridge, middle, and neck. Each pickup has a different tone and character. For this example, we will use the bridge pickup, which has a bright and punchy sound.
 
Next, we need to set up the LP Strum engine. We can open the Strum panel by clicking on the Strum button on the top right corner of the interface. Here we can see a grid that represents the strumming pattern. Each row corresponds to a string and each column corresponds to a beat. We can click on the cells to activate or deactivate them. We can also drag the cells to change their length and position.
 
We can choose from several presets that are categorized by genre and style. For this example, we will use the Rock 1 preset, which has a simple and steady pattern. We can also tweak the parameters below the grid to adjust the speed, dynamics, accent, swing, and humanization of the strums.
 
Now we are ready to play some chords. We can use the keyboard to trigger different chords that are mapped to different keys. The library comes with a chord recognition system that automatically detects the chord type and voicing based on the notes played. We can also customize the chords by using the Chord panel on the bottom left corner of the interface. Here we can change the root note, inversion, extension, and bass note of each chord.
