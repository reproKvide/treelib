If you are a fan of Japanese railways and scenic routes, you might want to check out the Train Simulator: Hidaka Main Line: Tomakomai - Hidaka-Mombetsu Route Add-On. This add-on, developed by Union Workshop, brings to life the coastal Hidaka Main Line that runs along the south coast of Hokkaido, Japan's second largest island[^1^].
  
The Hidaka Main Line was opened in 1913 as a narrow gauge railway, and was later converted to the standard 3 ft 6 in gauge in 1929. The line connects Tomakomai, a port city and industrial hub, with Hidaka-Mombetsu, a small town at the end of the peninsula. The line is about 146 km long and has 28 stations along the way[^1^].

The add-on features the KiHa 130 diesel multiple unit (DMU), which was introduced in 1988 to replace the older KiHa 40s. The KiHa 130s were specially designed for the Hidaka Main Line, and had a unique feature of being 'one-man trains', meaning that the driver was also responsible for selling tickets and taking care of passengers[^1^]. The KiHa 130s were retired in 2016, after being worn out by the harsh coastal environment[^1^].
