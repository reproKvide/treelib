# Abhiram Ranade C.pdf: A Book on Programming and Geometry
 
Abhiram Ranade C.pdf is a PDF file that contains two books by Abhiram Ranade, a professor of computer science and engineering at IIT Bombay. The first book is *An Introduction to Programming Through C++*, which teaches the basics of programming using the C++ language and a library called simplecpp. The second book is *Geometry for Programmers*, which explores various geometric concepts and problems from a computational perspective.
 
The first book, *An Introduction to Programming Through C++*, covers topics such as variables, expressions, control structures, functions, arrays, strings, pointers, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exceptions, file handling, and data structures. It also introduces the concept of turtle graphics, which is a way of drawing pictures using a virtual turtle that can move and turn on the screen. The book uses simplecpp, a library that simplifies some aspects of C++ and provides functions for graphics and animation. The book is suitable for beginners who want to learn programming through examples and exercises.

The second book, *Geometry for Programmers*, applies the programming skills learned in the first book to various geometric problems and challenges. It covers topics such as coordinate systems, vectors, matrices, transformations, polygons, circles, triangles, angles, trigonometry, similarity, congruence, area, volume, Pythagoras theorem, Euclid's algorithm, convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulations, shortest paths, visibility graphs, and computational geometry algorithms. The book uses simplecpp to illustrate the geometric concepts and solutions with graphics and animation. The book is suitable for intermediate programmers who want to enhance their mathematical and logical thinking.
