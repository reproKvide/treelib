In this article, we will show you how to use some of the features of DbVisualizer Pro 10.0.25 with an example database. We will use the sample database that comes with DbVisualizer, which is based on the classic Sakila database for MySQL. You can also use your own database by creating a new connection in DbVisualizer and selecting the appropriate database driver.
 
## Grid-based table editing
 
One of the features that makes DbVisualizer Pro 10.0.25 stand out from other SQL clients and editors is the grid-based table editing. This feature allows you to edit data directly in the result grid, without writing any SQL statements. You can also use various tools to manipulate the data, such as undo/redo, copy/paste, find/replace, fill down, increment/decrement, and more.
 
To use the grid-based table editing feature, you need to open a table or a query in the Data tab of DbVisualizer. For example, let's open the actor table from the sakila database by expanding the database browser on the left panel and double-clicking on the actor table under the Tables node. This will open a new tab with the actor table in the Data tab.
 
Now you can edit any cell in the result grid by double-clicking on it and typing a new value. For example, let's change the first name of the first actor from PENELOPE to PENELOPPE. As soon as you press Enter or click outside the cell, the change will be applied to the database. You can also see the SQL statement that was executed to make the change in the SQL Preview panel at the bottom.
 
If you want to undo or redo your changes, you can use the buttons on the toolbar or press Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+Y on your keyboard. You can also copy and paste data from one cell to another or from an external source, such as Excel or Notepad. To copy data, select one or more cells and press Ctrl+C or right-click and choose Copy. To paste data, select one or more cells and press Ctrl+V or right-click and choose Paste.
 
You can also use other tools to manipulate data in bulk, such as find/replace, fill down, increment/decrement, and more. To access these tools, right-click on one or more cells and choose Edit Cells from the context menu. This will open a dialog box with various options to modify the data.
 
For example, let's use the find/replace tool to replace all occurrences of ED in the last name column with EDWARD. To do this, select all cells in the last name column by clicking on the column header, right-click and choose Edit Cells > Find/Replace. In the dialog box that appears, enter ED in the Find field and EDWARD in the Replace field. Then click on Replace All to apply the changes.
 
As you can see, grid-based table editing is a very convenient and powerful feature that can save you time and effort when working with data in DbVisualizer Pro 10.0.25.
