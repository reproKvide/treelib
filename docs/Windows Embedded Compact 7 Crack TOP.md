## Features of Windows Embedded Compact 7
 
Windows Embedded Compact 7 offers a range of features that enable you to develop applications and user interfaces with rich functionality and performance. Some of these features are:
 
- **Silverlight for Windows Embedded:** This is a framework that allows you to create graphical user interfaces using Microsoft Expression Blend, a design tool that supports XAML and C#. Silverlight for Windows Embedded supports hardware acceleration, animation, vector graphics, media playback, and touch input.
- **Internet Explorer for Windows Embedded:** This is a web browser that is similar to the one in Windows Phone 7, with integrated Adobe Flash v10.1 support. It also supports HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, and DOM.
- **Touch support:** Windows Embedded Compact 7 recognizes touch and gesture input types, such as tap, double-tap, swipe, pinch, zoom, and rotate. It also provides a touch calibration tool and a touch driver interface.
- **CPU support:** Windows Embedded Compact 7 works on dual-core CPUs in symmetric multiprocessing mode, which means that both cores can run the same or different processes simultaneously. This improves the performance and responsiveness of the system.
- **Platform support:** Windows Embedded Compact 7 runs on various platforms, such as x86, SH4 (automotive only), MIPS, and ARMv7. It also supports different board support packages (BSPs) that provide drivers and libraries for specific hardware components.
- **Media playback:** Windows Embedded Compact 7 supports Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) and Media Transfer Protocol (MTP), which enable you to stream and transfer media files between devices. It also supports various audio and video formats, such as MP3, AAC, WMA, WMV, H.264, MPEG-4, and AVI.
- **Networking:** Windows Embedded Compact 7 includes NDIS 6.1 and supports Bluetooth 2.1 EDR. It also supports various protocols, such as TCP/IP, IPv6, DHCP, DNS, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, SMTP, SSL/TLS, UPnP, and Wi-Fi.
