# FULL Collaboration For Revit 2009 [32-64Bit]: A Guide to Cloud-Hosting of Revit Workshared Models
 
Revit is a powerful software for building information modeling (BIM) that allows architects, engineers, and contractors to design, analyze, and document buildings. However, working on large and complex projects with multiple team members can be challenging without a reliable and efficient way to share and collaborate on Revit models.
 
That's where FULL Collaboration For Revit 2009 [32-64Bit] comes in. This is a subscription service that works with Revit 2015 and later releases to enable multi-user coauthoring or cloud worksharing of Revit models. It utilizes cloud storage and your Autodesk ID to store and share Revit files through the cloud with users both within your own network and outside with other organizations, stakeholders, and other users. It also integrates with Autodesk BIM 360 Team, a centralized platform for communication, file sharing, and design reviews for design teams and their project stakeholders.

In this article, we will explain what FULL Collaboration For Revit 2009 [32-64Bit] is, how it works, what are its benefits, and how to set it up and use it for your projects.
  
## What is FULL Collaboration For Revit 2009 [32-64Bit]?
 
FULL Collaboration For Revit 2009 [32-64Bit] is a feature within Revit that adds new buttons to the Collaborate tab within your Revit. It allows you to create, access, share, and utilize cloud-workshared models in C4R (Collaboration for Revit). C4R is Autodesk's answer to cloud-hosting of Revit workshared models[^4^].
 
With C4R, you can work on the same model with other team members in real time using the Communicator chat tool within models. You can also access shared building information models from any device with an internet connection. You can view, comment, markup, compare, and track versions of the models using BIM 360 Team's web and mobile features.
 
A subscription to FULL Collaboration For Revit 2009 [32-64Bit] includes BIM 360 Team. BIM 360 Team is a centralized platform for communication, file sharing and design reviews for design teams and their project stakeholders[^5^]. It provides 500 GB cloud storage per user, a large model viewer, model comparison, markups, version history, and more.
  
## How does FULL Collaboration For Revit 2009 [32-64Bit] work?
 
FULL Collaboration For Revit 2009 [32-64Bit] works by hosting your Revit models in a centralized location called the BIM 360 Team Hub. This hub is a centralized repository to share digital information with entire project design teams. You need to create or join a BIM 360 Team Hub before you can share your model via C4R.

Once you have a BIM 360 Team Hub, you can upload your existing Revit models or create new ones using C4R. You can invite other team members to join your hub and assign them permissions to access your models. You can also invite external users such as clients or consultants who do not use Revit but need to view or comment on your models using BIM 360 Team's web interface.
 
When you open a cloud-workshared model using C4R, you do not need to create a new local copy on your machine. You can work on the model as normal using Revit's tools and commands. You can also use the Communicator chat tool within models to communicate with other team members in real time. You can sync your changes with the central model in the cloud at any time using the Synchronize with Central button.
 
You can also access your cloud-workshared models from any device with an internet connection using BIM 360 Team's web interface. You can view, comment, markup, compare, and track versions of the models using BIM 360 Team's features. You can also download a copy of the model if you need to work offline.
