## Step 1: Insert the CD into your computer
 
The first step is to insert the CD that came with your EVGA Nvidia Geforce graphics card into your computer's CD-ROM drive. If you don't have a CD-ROM drive, you can download the drivers from the EVGA website instead. You can find the download link for your specific graphics card model on the product page or in the user manual.
 
## Step 2: Run the setup file
 
Once you insert the CD, a window should pop up automatically with the option to run the setup file. If it doesn't, you can open the CD folder manually and double-click on the setup file. The setup file should have a name like "setup.exe" or "EVGA\_Nvidia\_Geforce\_Driver\_Installation\_CD\_Ver\_09-210-50-1.exe".
 
## Step 3: Follow the on-screen instructions
 
After you run the setup file, you will see a welcome screen with the EVGA logo and some information about the driver installation. Click on "Next" to continue. You will then see a license agreement screen where you need to accept the terms and conditions before proceeding. Click on "I Agree" and then on "Next". You will then see a screen where you can choose the installation type. You can either select "Express" or "Custom". We recommend choosing "Express" for most users as it will install the drivers with the default settings and options. If you want more control over the installation process, you can choose "Custom" and customize the components and features that you want to install. Click on "Next" after choosing your installation type. The installation will then begin and may take several minutes depending on your system configuration. You will see a progress bar and some messages indicating the status of the installation.
 
## Step 4: Restart your computer
 
Once the installation is complete, you will see a screen that says "Installation Complete". Click on "Finish" to exit the setup. You may be prompted to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. If so, click on "Yes" and wait for your computer to reboot. If not, you can restart your computer manually later.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy your EVGA Nvidia Geforce graphics card
 
Congratulations! You have successfully installed the EVGA Nvidia Geforce drivers from the CD (Ver 09-210-50-1). You can now enjoy your EVGA Nvidia Geforce graphics card and its features. You can also check for updates and manage your settings using the Nvidia Control Panel or GeForce Experience software that came with your drivers.
  
## How to Update EVGA Nvidia Geforce Drivers
 
It is important to keep your EVGA Nvidia Geforce drivers updated to ensure the best performance and compatibility with your games and applications. There are two ways to update your drivers: manually or automatically.
 
### Manual Update
 
If you want to update your drivers manually, you can visit the EVGA website and download the latest drivers for your graphics card model. You can find the download link on the product page or in the user manual. You will need to know your graphics card model name and number, which you can find on the box or on the card itself. You will also need to know your operating system and its version. Once you download the driver file, you can run it and follow the same steps as described above for installing the drivers from the CD.
 
### Automatic Update
 
If you want to update your drivers automatically, you can use the GeForce Experience software that came with your drivers. GeForce Experience is a program that helps you optimize your games and keep your drivers up to date. To use GeForce Experience, you need to create an account and log in. You can then click on the "Drivers" tab and see if there are any available updates for your graphics card. If there are, you can click on "Download" and then on "Express Installation" to install the updates automatically. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.
