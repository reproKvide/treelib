# How to Download and Install Windows 10 Pro Redstone 5 X64
 
Windows 10 Pro Redstone 5 X64 is the latest version of Windows 10 that brings new features, improvements and fixes to the operating system. If you want to try out this version of Windows 10, you can download the ISO files from Microsoft's website and perform a clean install on your PC.
 
A clean install means that you will erase everything on your hard drive and install Windows 10 from scratch. This can help you avoid any compatibility issues, bugs or errors that may occur when upgrading from an older version of Windows. However, before you proceed with a clean install, make sure you have backed up your important files and data to an external drive or cloud service.
